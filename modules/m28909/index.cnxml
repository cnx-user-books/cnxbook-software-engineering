      <title>Description </title>
      <para id="id34720515">Software engineering is a very broad field. It encompase virtual everything a person might want to know in order to develop software - software that is correct, on time, and on budget. Most other computer science courses emphasize the technical foundations of software development, such as programming, algorithms, data structures, languages, etc.</para>
      <para id="id34720525">This course focusses on the pragmatic aspects, such as requirements analysis, cost estimation, design, team organization, quality control, configuration management, verification, testing, and maintenance. Students work in teams on projects for real clients. This work includes a feasibility study, requirements analysis, object-oriented design, implementation, testing, and delivery to the client. Additional topics covered in lectures include professionalism, project management, and the legal framework for software development.</para>

      <title>Organization</title>
      <para id="id38285672">Class sessions will be a combination of lecture and seminar formats. We'll cover the course's primary topics in these sessions, with reading and homework assigments that provide opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying issues and techniques of software engineering. Actual labs and software development projects will provide a hands-on approach to exploring these topics throughout the semester. Given that this is a 3 credit course, it is expected that you will spend an average of 10 hours per week (including in-class and lab time) on the course and related material for the duration of the semester.</para>

      <list id="id36911225" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>Make sure you know what you want to get out of the course before you get very far into it; there are lots of directions to go in, and having a focus will help to inspire you </item>
        <item>Update your journal often; use it as a tool to develop / explore ideas and track your progress </item>
        <item>Remember that the larger software development project is something to be considered throughout the semester; don't wait until the end! </item>
        <item>Raise concerns early; if an assignment or milestone doesn't seem feasible, say so as soon as you can </item>
